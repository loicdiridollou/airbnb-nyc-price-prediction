machine-learning-nanodegree

In this repository, there are all the files I have used to work on my Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. <br>

For the capstone project, I decided to work on data from AirBnB in New York City to build and backtest different models 
based on machine learning to predict the prices of stays depending on the different caracteristics.
